#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Linear, O(n). Code contains a simple while loop that requires no additional runtime than quick, simple, math operations to exit the loop

b) Logarithmic, O(log n) Even with low inputs, the nested while loop within the for loop adds additional checks which logarithmically extend the time it takes to complete the algorithim. 

c) Linear, O(n). Steps in code increases linearly with the number of inputs.

## Exercise II
Establish building height of n
Start at middle floor and drop egg. If broken, move down one floor. If it doesn't break, move up one floor.

(Binary search, with a runtime of O(n) )
